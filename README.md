# GeoPyBangladesh

You can use it in 'Order Placement forms' or in any other type of forms where **zilla and upazilla** input from **select (html tag)** is required.

* In `geodata.json` you have all the data required. Simple parse the JSON in your favourite language and use it anywhere.
* To fetch the latest geo data from http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd simple run `fetcher.py` and it will update `geodata.json`. But as zilla and upazilla names are almost static data, so you can safely use the repository's `geodata.json`. 

Cheers!
